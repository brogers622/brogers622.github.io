From guiding a preschooler's journey towards counting to a personalized multivariable calculus course for the [youngest SpaceX engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairan_Quazi), I've taught a variety of subjects in a variety of contexts since I began tutoring in high school. I've primarily tutored math and physics, but have also offered English, ACT/SAT prep, 3D modelling, and engineering courses.From most recent to longest ago, my tutoring experiences are breifly described below.

##### [**Lexicon Academics**](https://www.lexiconacademics.com/), 2023-2024
At-home, personalized 3D printing, 3D modelling, and engineering skills courses for students in NYC
##### [**USC Viterbi Learning Program**](https://viterbiundergrad.usc.edu/viterbilearningprogram/), 2019-2021
After each undergrad engineering course I completed, I added it to my portfolio of tutoring offerings. I provided custom, one-on-one tutoring and homework help to fellow engineering students in undergraduate math, physics, and mechanical engineering courses.
##### [**TalentNook**](https://talentnook.com/), 2019-2020
I developed and taught custom multivariable calculus courses to students who sought an early start on their calculus studies. Some students were in person and some were virtual. Among my virtual students was [Kairen Quazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairan_Quazi), who went on to become the youngest graduate of Santa Clara University and youngest engineer at SpaceX.
##### [**Mathnasium**](https://www.mathnasium.com/), 2018-2019
An after-school math homework help center. I worked with groups of ~8 students at a time, including preschoolers learning to count, high school seniors learning calculus, and everyone in between.
##### [**JEI Learning Center**](https://jeilearning.com/), 2018-2019
My very first tutoring experience! I tutored middle school English and algebra.
