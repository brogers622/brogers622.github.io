### Cultivating Careers Podcast, 2023
Jeffray Behr, a colleague of mine, hosts the [Cultivating Careers in Alternative Proteins](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1884302) podcast, in which he discusses various alternative-protein-related topics with guests. I was interviewed in [Episode 23](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1884302/episodes/13537326-ep-23-bryce-rogers-project-engineer-at-edge-foods-and-natalie-fernandez-aspiring-alternative-proteins-mechanical-engineer) while at Edge Foods and in [Episode 35.5](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1884302/episodes/17302823-ep-35-5-what-are-past-guests-up-to-now-final-episode-part-5-bryce-rogers) while at Simulate.
### Talist Blog Post, 2023
Also while at Edge Foods, I was interviewed for a blog post by [TÃ¤list](https://talist.org/), an organization that aims to provide professionals with resources to pivot to a career in alternative proteins. The post, in which I discuss my experience leading up to and at Edge Foods, is titled [Case Study: Biomechanical Engineer in Alternative Proteins](https://talist.org/case-study-biomechanical-engineer).
### High Impact Engineering Presentation at UC Berkeley, 2022
On behalf of High Impact Engineers, I gave a talk at UC Berkeley about strategies to pursue a highly socially impactful engineering career.
### Acoustic Streaming Research Presentation
Before working with Dr. Pahlevan (See the *Hemodynamics Research Papers* project highlight), I also worked under [Dr. Anita Penkova](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Penkova/Anita) to investigate the fluid dynamics of [acoustic streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_streaming#:~:text=Acoustic%20streaming%20is%20a%20steady,waves%20within%20a%20Kundt's%20tube.), a net flow induced by sound waves in a fluid. I investigated the phenomenon using the open source computational fluid dynamics tool [OpenFOAM](https://www.openfoam.com/), and presented my team's findings in a virtual undergraduate symposium:
