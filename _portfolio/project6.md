### High Impact Engineers, Operations Lead
After graduating college, from 2022-early 2023, I was Operations Lead at [High Impact Engineers](https://www.highimpactengineers.org/), an organized that aims to provide engineers with resources and connections to pursue careers of maximally positive social impact. As Operations Lead, I wrote articles (eg an earlier version of [this article](https://www.highimpactengineers.org/how-engineers-can-have-impact-working-in-biosecurity)), gave a talk to the UC Berkeley chapter of Effective Altruism, attended conferences to community build, and generally participated in the growth of the organization.

My work at HIE felt enjoyable and meaninful, but I eventually left for Edge Foods as I knew I wanted my career to be in object-level engineering work, rather than engineering community building.
### Catering
I've catered two film sets for close friends. In early 2024 on which I was [caterer and choreographer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33295155/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt) for the short narrative film[Delicates](https://www.instagram.com/delicates.film/) and in the Summer of 2024 I catered for the short dance film ODDLOOP
### Lindy Hop Social Dance
Lindy Hop - an early 20th century Harlem swing dance - has been a big part of my life in New York. In the Summer of 2024 I hosted a Lindy Hop social dance/potluck in my backyard! It was heartful and fun and I can't wait to host another.

### Amador Valley High School Super Smash Bros. Club, Cofounder and Copresident
My younger brother and I cofounded a Super Smash Bros. Club at our high school in 2016. We played weekly during lunch in the library and occasionally held inter-school tournaments! It attracted dozens of members its first year and is still kicking to this day.
