### High Impact Engineers, Operations Lead


### Lindy Hop Social Dance
Lindy Hop - an early 20th century Harlem swing dance - has been a big part of my life in New York. In the Summer of 2024 I hosted a Lindy Hop social dance/potluck in my backyard! It was heartful and fun and I can't wait to host another.

### Amador Valley High School Super Smash Bros. Club, Cofounder and Copresident
My younger brother and I cofounded a Super Smash Bros. Club at our high school in 2016. We played weekly during lunch in the library and occasionally held inter-school tournaments! It attracted dozens of members its first year and is still kicking to this day.
