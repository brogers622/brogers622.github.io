From the Summer of 2017 to the Spring of 2018, during a gap year between high school and college, I worked at NASA Ames Research Center as an exobiology research assistant. My provided engineering and research assistance on varied projects, the most significant of which were
1. Volatile Ice Rheology Instrument Proposal
2. Mars Habitat Protype
3. ELSAH Collector Cone Design Research
4. Icebreaker Biobarrier Concept build 

### Volatile Ice Rheology Instrument Proposal
I provided design input and CAD drawings for a funding proposal for the design and manufacture of an instrument intended to measure the rheological properties of ice. It was submitted in December 2017 to Dr. Michael Bicay, Director of Science at NASA Ames Research Center. I contributed the 3D CAD drawings of the proposed instrument on page 12 of the proposal. A pdf of the proposal can be accessed (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzKrghSNgKhpZlSLACby9nEdcGHyVoBi/view?usp=drive_link "here").

David Wilson, my boss, designed a multipurpose habitat for extended crewed missions on Mars. I assisted the construction of a full-scale cross section for the presentation of his proposed design. Using his design, I made CAD models of the pieces of the prototype and cut them using a 3 axis CNC mill. Figure 1 shows a piece of the circular frame being milled. Figure 2 shows both halves of the section model under construction. Figure 3 shows the completed top and bottom halves of the cross section.

ELSAH is a proposed NASA mission in which a craft would be sent to Saturnâ€™s moon Enceladus to collect samples from its plumes and assess the possibility of life. I assisted researching potential sample collector designs. Figure 4 shows the cross section of a cone-shaped collector prototype designed  by my boss David Wilson and modeled by me. Figure 5 shows a 3D printed model of the collector insert. David and I used the manufactured ice collector prototypes in Figure 6 for experimental tests. The prototypes were manufactured by an independent machine shop.

Icebreaker Life is a proposed NASA mission to investigate for signs of life on Mars. I designed, 3D modeled, and constructed a model of the Icebreaker mission biobarrier for presentation purposes (not for actual mission use). A biobarrier is a protective seal used to prevent astronautical equipment from contaminating other planets with Earth life. Figures 7 and 8 show CAD and wood models of the biobarrier, respectively.
