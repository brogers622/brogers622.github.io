Between 2020-2022 I had the privilege of working in the biomechanical research lab of [Dr. Niema Pahlevan](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Pahlevan/Niema). Under the guidance of Dr. Pahlevan and his then-PhD student (now Dr.) [Dr. Arian Aghilinejad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arian-aghilinejad-85828b108/), I coauthored two papers on cardiovascular fluid dynamics. The [first paper](https://github.com/brogers622/portfolio/blob/18c59b9fa894b4369f521322821fec689fcc526e/1st%20coauthored%20paper.pdf) investigated whether vessel wall displacement could be used as a noninvasive proxy for internal vessel pressure in calculating a novel pressure-based index of cardiovascular health. The [second paper](https://github.com/brogers622/portfolio/blob/18c59b9fa894b4369f521322821fec689fcc526e/2nd%20coathored%20paper.pdf) explored the frequency-dependent pumping behavior exhibited by compliant vessels in cyclically stretched longitudinally.

### Acoustic Streaming Research + Presentation
Before working with Dr. Pahlevan, I also worked with [Dr. Anita Penkova](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Penkova/Anita) to investigate the fluid dynamics of [acoustic streaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_streaming#:~:text=Acoustic%20streaming%20is%20a%20steady,waves%20within%20a%20Kundt's%20tube.), a net flow induced by sounds waves in a fluid. I investigate the phenomenon using the open source computational fluid dynamics tool OpenFOAM, and presented my team's findings in a virtual undergraduate symposium [Google Drive video link here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZN7Vfau2ATikSEVXnsze9H4Ha9w9JrO/view?usp=drive_link).
