I've worked at three early-stage climate tech companies since moving to NYC at the beginning of 2023: **Edge Foods**, **CarbonBridge**, and **TomTex**.


## CarbonBridge, Mechanical Engineer
[CarbonBridge](https://carbonbridge.io/) is a pre-seed startup currently headquartered at the [HAX space in Newark](https://hax.co/). CarbonBridge converts methane waste gas to liquid methanol fuel via direct-gas bacterial fermentation.

My responsibilities as a mechanical engineer included bioreactor design, fluid control, temperature control, downstream process design, scaling planning, and miscellaneous engineering and experimentation support tasks. Show below left is an off-the shelf membrane filter holder I selected as an early bioreactor for CarbonBridge's methanol producing bacteria. Below right is this filter holder in a fluid control circuit with a syringe pump programmed to deliver gas and liquid at predtermined intervals. This system allowed the biology team to run experiments quickly and repeatedly, and produced significantly higher titers of methanol than were previously produced.

The above reactor has a diameter of about 5cm. Once its successful use was demonstrated, I designed and manufactured an 8in diameter version, shown below alone and attached to its fluid control circuit. The fluid control was performed by a peristaltic pump and an Arduino microcontroller. In part due to the success of this system, CarbonBridge was selected for a [Greenwells grant by ARPA-E](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carbonbridge_arpaegreenwells-decarbonize-methanol-activity-7226101649805635585-ts0E?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop).

Additionally, I built a temperature feedback control system for three bacteria incubators, shown below. Each control system consisted of heated blanket wrapped around the incubator, a thermocouple sensor to measure incubator temperature, a relay to switch on/off power to a blanket, and a programmable PID controller to control the relay.
