In the final semester of our mechanical engineering bachelors at USC, two other students and I designed and fabricated a novel device that converted water wave energy to electrical energy. The process is summarized below; for more detailed descriptions feel free to check out the [final report](assets/img/portfolio/wec/report.pdf) and [presentation slides](assets/img/portfolio/wec/slides.pdf).
### Design
The goal of the device was to convert a portion of a water wave's kinetic and potential energy to electrical energy by leveraging pressure variation over it's wavelength. A diagram of the device is shown below:

The system consists of two rigid boxes connected by a rigid tube. The top of each rigid box has a large orifice covered by a compliant membrane. Because the boxes are sealed by these membranes, the fluid inside the system is closed off from the external environment and thus maintains a constant volume. Inside the tube is a piston that may slide with relatively little and separates the internal system volume into two equal volumes.

 The system is submerged in shallow water, and waves propagate from left to right over the system. The boxes are separated such that they are subjected to pressure waves that are out of phase with each other. This results in a periodic pressure differential across both membranes, which causes the the membranes to bulge in and out cyclically, which pushes the piston back and forth through the tube.

 The piston has a magnet inside of it, and a solenoid is coiled around the exterior of the tube. Consequently, as the piston-magnet oscillates in the tube, a portion of its kinetic energy is converted electromagnetically to electrical energy.
