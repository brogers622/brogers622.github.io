In the final semester of our mechanical engineering bachelors at USC, two other students and I designed and fabricated a novel device that converted water wave energy to electrical energy. The process is summarized below; for more detailed descriptions feel free to check out the [final report](assets/img/portfolio/wec/slides.pdf) and [presentation slides](assets/img/portfolio/wec/slides.pdf).
### Design

### Fabrication

### Data Collection
