From the Summer of 2017 to the Spring of 2018, during a gap year between high school and college, I worked at NASA Ames Research Center as an exobiology research assistant under the leadership of [Dr. Christoper McKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_McKay). I provided engineering and research assistance on varied projects, the most significant of which were: **Ice Rheology Instrument Proposal**, **ELSAH Collector Cone Design Research**, **Mars Habitat Protype**, and **Icebreaker Biobarrier Concept Build**.

### Ice Rheology Instrument Proposal
I provided design input and CAD drawings for a funding proposal for the design and manufacture of an instrument intended to measure the rheological properties of ice on Pluto. It was submitted in December 2017 to [Dr. Michael Bicay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Bicay), Director of Science at NASA Ames Research Center. I contributed the 3D CAD drawings of the proposed instrument on page 12 of the proposal. A pdf of the proposal can be accessed [here](https://github.com/brogers622/portfolio/blob/64a3e6f8874ff6110cf48e0aaaf6ff31f416f632/NASA%20Instrument%20Funding%20Proposal.pdf).

### ELSAH Collector Cone Design Research
[ELSAH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus_Life_Signatures_and_Habitability) is a proposed NASA mission in which a craft would pass by Saturnâ€™s moon Enceladus and through its plumes to collect material samples and assess the possibility of life. I assisted the design and 3D modelling of potential collector cone designs. A CAD model of a cone cross section and a 3D print of a cone insert are shown below.

The manufactured stainless steel cones are shone below. To test collection efficacy, my boss [David Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-willson-92713b8b/) and I launched a known mass of microbeads at each cone (to emulate a plume fly-by) and measured cone mass before and after.

### Mars Habitat Protype
David designed a multipurpose habitat for extended crewed missions on Mars. I assisted the construction of a full-scale mockup of one cylindrical section for the presentation of his proposed design to fellow scientists.

Based on his design, I made 3D and 2D CAD models of the pieces necessary to construct a wood prototype and cut them out of plywood using a 3 axis CNC mill, as shown below.

The top and bottom halves of the cylindrical mockup section are shown below.

### Icebreaker Biobarrier Concept Build
Icebreaker Life is a proposed NASA mission to investigate for signs of life on Mars. I designed, 3D modeled, and constructed a model of the Icebreaker mission biobarrier for presentation purposes (not for actual mission use). A biobarrier is a protective seal used to prevent astronautical equipment from contaminating other planets with Earth life. CAD and wood models of the biobarrier are shown below.
