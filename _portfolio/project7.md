### High Impact Engineers | Operations Lead
After graduating from college, from 2022 to early 2023, I co-organized [High Impact Engineers](https://www.highimpactengineers.org/), an organization that aims to provide physical engineers with resources to pursue careers of maximally positive impact. As Operations Lead, I wrote articles (eg. an earlier version of [this article](https://www.highimpactengineers.org/how-engineers-can-have-impact-working-in-biosecurity)), gave a talk to the UC Berkeley chapter of Effective Altruism, attended conferences to community-build, and participated in the decisions behind the direction and growth of the organization.

My work at HIE felt meaningful, but I eventually left for Edge Foods as I knew I wanted my career to be in object-level engineering work, rather than engineering community building.
### Catering
I've catered three film sets for friends: ODDLOOP short dance film, [BOYS music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YiutXu4_oA&list=RD-YiutXu4_oA&start_radio=1), and the short narrative film [Delicates](https://www.instagram.com/delicates.film/), for which I was also [choreographer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt33295155/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt).
### Lindy Hop Social Dance
Lindy Hop - an early 20th century Harlem swing dance - has been a big part of my life in New York. Early in the Summer of 2024, I achieved my dream of hosting a Lindy Hop social in my backyard! It was heartful potluck with several hours of dancing, shown below (I'm in the blue shirt!).

At the end of the Summer I hosted another social, bigger and with live music!

### Amador Valley High School Super Smash Bros. Club | Cofounder and Copresident
My younger brother and I cofounded a Super Smash Bros. Club at our high school in 2016. We played weekly during lunch in the library and occasionally held inter-school tournaments. It attracted dozens of members its first year and is still kicking to this day.
