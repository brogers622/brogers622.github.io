Notes, outlining, etc

Want to have site able to be shown during climate week - can keep updating it but even monday it should be presentable

Sections:
- title: "About"
first, high level overview+intro

- title: "Timeline"
more detailed+graphical overview of my history - the times, locations, organizations, and roles I've had

- title: "Portfolio"
detailed descriptions of my most impressive projects/roles

Include:
- title: "Services"
turn this into a skills section?

- title: "Team"
could be combined with contact? A photo, resume link, detailed portfolio link?, an LI link are probl all i need

- title: "Contact"
combine w team?

- title: "Theme Source"
Should probably delete this. I love the idea of keeping it in the spirit of open source, but its probably a better look not to have it








Random
Should probably delete the sponsors? or maybe replace with places ive been? But that could be redundant with the Timeline
just delete all the spanish translated sections?
