    subtext: ">From NASA instrumentation research to hemodynamic simulation and biomanufacturing for climate startups,
    I've been lucky to have had the opportunity to work on a diversity of engineering problems.\n\n
    
    I grew up in the [East Bay](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pleasanton,+CA/@37.7326523,-122.2526358,87396m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x808fe9a261ba755f:0xb3ab6847e1ea7d16!8m2!3d37.6604484!4d-121.8757968!16zL20vMHF4X3o?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
    and got my Mechanical Engineering BS at [USC](https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+of+Southern+California/@34.0197702,-118.312157,10077m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x80c2c7e49c71a5ed:0xaa905a5bb427a2c4!8m2!3d34.0223519!4d-118.285117!16s%2Fm%2F065y4w7?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTEyNC4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).
    I currently work in the [Brooklyn Navy Yard](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brooklyn+Navy+Yard,+Brooklyn,+NY/@40.7033459,-73.9766218,2988m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89c25bcb04068eff:0xf0f55e579be004b2!8m2!3d40.6991765!4d-73.9715838!16s%2Fg%2F11fm4dqbd7?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIwNC4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)
    as Mechanical Engineering Lead at [Simulate](https://simulate.com/) developing a novel fiber-spun plant based chicken breast.
    Previously, I assisted exobiology research at [NASA Ames](https://www.nasa.gov/ames/),
    coauthored [two](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34775340/) [papers](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/pof/article-abstract/35/9/091903/2909841/On-the-longitudinal-wave-pumping-in-fluid-filled?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
    on hemodynamic simulation, co-organized [High Impact Engineers](https://www.highimpactengineers.org/), and worked at three other sustainability-oriented startups in NYC
    [Edge Foods](https://www.bulletpitch.com/p/Edge), [TômTex](https://www.tomtex.com/), and [CarbonBridge](https://carbonbridge.io/).\n\n
    
    In each of my varied roles, I've sought expertise that unlocks creativity and illuminates connectedness with other fields.
    Outside of physics-based problem solving, I like to organize swing dances, cook for friends, and play games of many kinds."
