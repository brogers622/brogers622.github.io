    text: "Welcome to my digital portfolio"
    subtext: ">Hello! I'm a Brooklyn-based mechanical engineer with a background in mechanical design and prototyping, biomechanics,
    fluid simulation and control, and early-stage climate tech startups. In addition to physics-based problem solving, I like to dance, cook for friends,
    and play games of many kinds.\n\n
    
    I grew up in the East San Fancisco Bay Area, got my BS in Mechanical Engineering at USC, and currently live in NYC. I've been grateful
    to have been able to engage in a diversity of technical fields, including exobiology research at NASA Ames,
    3D CAD contracting for auto parts manufacturing, aortic hemodynamics research, recombinant protein processing, bioreactor design
    for microbial methanol production, and shrimp-shell-based alternative leather manufacturing.\n\n
    
    In each role I occupy, I pursue the expertise necessary to unlock creative and goal-oriented problem solving.
    In doing so I've gained an appreciation for many fields' unique subject matters and developed strategies for
    applied technical learning. I find that even apparently dissimilar technical projects can be tackled via first principles thinking combined with high-level
    goal orientedness and enthusiastic curiosity!"
